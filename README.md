## Learning Goals

- Improve speed at common tasks by learning command line tools

## Introduction

There are some tasks that you will find yourself doing many times a day as a developer. You want those tasks to be lightning fast, so that you can get more done. Developers have been using the command line for centuries (okay, maybe just decades) and have built tremendous tools for getting the common tasks done quickly.

In order to be productive with these tools, you need to build the muscle memory for them, as well as recognize their usefulness. Do the practice exercises on [Shortcut Foo's Command Line Course](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/command-line). For each of the commands you learn, see what the output is in your own terminal, as well as practicing the commands in the playground. Completing the sequence of lessons (8 sections in total) will take about 2 hours of focused time.

Tips:

- Use the 'Show' option to give you hints when you are first learning the commands. Turn them off to practice recalling the commands.
- Some of the commands might not work on mac (they are Unix utilities). Search for alternatives that you can use yourself.
- The best learning will be from using the commands in your day-to-day coding. Try to apply these tips to your own command line use.
- You may need to revisit these practice sessions in order to fill in gaps. Put time on your calendar for a month from now to go back through these exercises and see which commands you use and which ones you don't.
